# banknote-authentication-deep-learning
This notebook implements a deep learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify banknotes as genuine or forged using features extracted from images. The dataset consists of wavelet-transformed images with features such as variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy. The model aims to improve authentication accuracy.
